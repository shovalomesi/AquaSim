## README for AquaSim

### Project Description
AquaSim is a Java-based application that simulates an aquatic environment where various swimmable creatures, like fish and jellyfish, inhabit an aquarium. Users can interact with the environment by adding creatures, feeding them, and observing their behaviors, which are influenced by concurrent programming constructs.

### Features
- **Graphical User Interface**: Utilizes Java Swing to provide an interactive GUI.
- **Add Creatures**: Support for adding either fish or jellyfish to the aquarium.
- **Concurrent Behaviors**: Creatures swim in real-time and react to food, with movement and behavior managed by threads and synchronization mechanisms.
- **Interactivity**: Users can feed creatures, put them to sleep, wake them up, and reset the aquarium environment.
- **Customization**: Users can customize the speed and size of the creatures as well as their colors.

### Installation
1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher.
   - Java Runtime Environment (JRE) to run the Java application.

2. **Downloading the Application**:
   - Clone the repository or download the ZIP of the project.
   - Extract the files to your preferred directory.

3. **Compiling the Code**:
   - Navigate to the directory containing the source files.
   - Compile the Java files using the following command:
     ```sh
     javac *.java
     ```

### Usage
To run AquaSim:
1. Open a command line interface (CLI).
2. Navigate to the directory containing the compiled Java files.
3. Execute the application using:
   ```sh
   java AquaFrame
   ```

### How to Interact with AquaSim
- **Add Animal**: Click on 'Add Animal' to choose between a fish or a jellyfish, set its properties like size and speed, and add it to the aquarium.
- **Feed**: Click on 'Food' to drop food into the tank, and watch as the creatures react and move towards the food.
- **Control Creatures**: Use 'Sleep' to pause the movement of all creatures, and 'Wake up' to resume their activity.
- **Reset Aquarium**: Clears all creatures from the aquarium and resets the environment.
